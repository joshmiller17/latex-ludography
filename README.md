# LaTeX Ludography
A collection of BibTeX data for games and the code for formatting a ludography in LaTeX.

## How to Use
1. Download the `games.bib` file and place it in your LaTeX source code.
2. Copy the header code at the top of `main.tex` marked `--- LUDOGRAPHY ---` and similarly the bibliography code at the bottom. Place these appropriately into your main tex file.
3. Cite games using `\citegame{name}`, see the `main.tex` provided for examples.
