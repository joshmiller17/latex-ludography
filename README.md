# LaTeX Ludography
A collection of BibTeX data for games and the code for formatting a ludography in LaTeX.

## How to Use
Download the `games.bib` file and place it in your LaTeX source code. Cite items in `games.bib` as you would cite any other `.bib` file.
[TODO more on how to use the code to generate the ludography]
